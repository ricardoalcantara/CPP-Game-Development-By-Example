# Linux build

I've used premake to build the linux version

> Premake for windows was not tested

Because the given assets path is relative you must be inside the Project folder where the Assets folder is: 

eg.

```bash
$ cd Chapter04/4.SFMLProject/SFMLProject
$ ../bin/Debug-linux-x86_64/4.SFMLProject/4.SFMLProject
```
